Easy anad natural way to interact with different ellements using handtracking 

## Introduction
This code is my end of carreer project. The idea is to implement handtracking to the different elements in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) using Web XR. The different elements in the scene will react and interact with the different gestures like hoovering and grabbing. 

The current implemented gestures are: 

* Hover: Touch the entity with the hand
* Grab: Doing a gesture while hoovering an entity to interact with it
* Stretch: Grab the entity with both hands to resize it
* Drag: Grab the entity with the right hand to move it freely 
* slide: Grab the entity with the left hand to slide it in an specific axis or plane
* Click: While doing the point gesture you can click on the element
